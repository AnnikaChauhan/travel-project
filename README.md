# Explorer - Personal React App Project
This was my personal project that I built entirely alone towards the end of the course. It is a React app with a Firebase backend - incorporating: react routing, state & props and reusable components, it also has a firebase authentication system, is attached to a firebase database (where the app can get data and can also post data too), it also connects to several APIs to return information to the user.

This app was build in React. If you clone this repo down you will need to do a 'yarn install' in the terminal in order to install all of the related packages. You can then do a 'yarn start' to view a demo version of the app as you make changes.

This app is available [here](https://travel-project-d6827.firebaseapp.com/home).

Access the Trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/oYWDrEeS/travel-site) to see additional features that I intend to build in the future.

## How to Use
Note: There are instructions on the about page of the app too :)
Log in or sign up to access the content. If you would just like access to the test account please get in touch by email or linkedIn.
Click the blogs section to view yours and other peoples blogs.
You can create your own blog posts by clicking the 'New Post' button.
On the Explore page you can search any city worldwide to find out about the weather there and also see what the top attractions in that city are.

## **Important Notes**
I am aware you cannot currently post additional blog posts, this is because something has changed in the firestore and I am working on a fix.

I am aware that there seems to be a bug in the 'blogs' and 'explore' pages when you view on a Windows computer. This error does not occur on a Mac (where my code is produced) and I am unsure what is wrong at this stage. There is nothing visibly incorrect in the code. I have reviewed each component in turn and cannot find any issues. If the horizontal scroll appears halfway through the 'public blogs' section (or the search results), eliminating any of the blog posts underneath, you are able to see what components are visible underneath by selecting/highlighting all of the text. I have noticed that highlighting the text 'acts' as a sort of eraser. If you have any suggestions on how I can fix this bug please let me know!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
